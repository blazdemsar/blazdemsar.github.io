Hi there! 

I'm Blaž and I come from Slovenia (look for a small country between Italy, Austria and Croatia).
We may not have met face-to-face (or camera-to-camera) yet, so I figured quick introductions are in order!

As mentioned above, I'm from Slovenia (perhaps you've heard of Luka Dončić, our basketball star before) and it's where I grew up.
Speaking of sports - I used to swim! 17 years to be exact, and it's been one hell of a ride (tide?). I started when
I was 7, enjoying splashing coaches more than swimming itself, until I saw Michael Phelps win his 8th gold medal 
at the Olymipcs in Beijing. Why was this such a pivotal moment - well like many kids out there, I started dreaming of
going to United States!

And so I worked hard, in and out of the pool all the way through middle & high-school, until one day, an email from
East Carolina University came through with an opportunity of a lifetime! So I grabbed a pen and signed a bunch of
papers, sat on the plane and off I went to the USA. It's now 2016 already, I'm studying (Computer Science) and
swimming in the States - living my dreams! Breezing through college days, I put my cap & gown on in 2020 and graduated 
via Zoom (you know, Covid and all).

After graduation, I started my professional career as a Software Engineer - if you're interested, I kindly invite you
to check out [my career page](career.md).

Hopefully you now know a bit more about me and what I've been up to! I'd would also love to get to know you as well
though, so you'll find a link to my LinkedIn profile at the bottom of this page or you can just use the link
[here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/blazdemsar489852174). Let's connect there and start chatting!

Sincerely,
<br/>
Blaž Demšar
