Let me tell you all about what I've been up to.

## Birth - 2012

Come on now, who even remembers what they did up until they were six years old. And then I already
went to school!

Throughout primary and middle school I made plenty of friends, some of them I still regularly keep up with.
By 3rd grade, I also tried in multiple sports - skiing, football (or soccer for my US friends), karate, judo, basketball  
and handball, but nothing really peaked my interest for long. Meanwhile, my younger brother started swimming
and watching him practice looked like tons of fun, so I did the reasonable thing - start swimming!

I loved being in the water and splashing the coaches more than swimming itself, but it all changed after the first 
competition where I won my first gold medal! After that, I took things a bit more seriously and was rapidly improving.

In 2008, I watched Michael Phelps win 8 gold medals at the Olympic Games in Beijing while sipping orange juice at the 
beach in Croatia when I got a ðŸ’¡moment - I want to go to United States!

My parents said if I worked hard, had good grades and good results from swimming, I might get a chance to study there.
Through hard work both in school and in the pool I ended up getting into Gimnazija BeÅ¾igrad
where I would be further pursuing my dreams.

## 2012 - 2016

In 2012 I started my days at Gimnazija BeÅ¾igrad (or High School) where I took particular interest in Chemistry - 
I'd say I liked organic chemistry but who am I fooling. Needless to say, I was still swimming during this time
and I ended up making the cut for European Youth Olympic Festival (kinda big thing for kids of that age).

Throughout the years, my desire to study in the States only grew stronger, so I began a meticulous research of
the requirements and talking to swim coaches at different universities to express my interests. 

In early 2016, I heard back from East Carolina University with some of the best news possible - a 4-year athletic
scholarship that opened the doors for my dreams to come true - study in US of course!
